#Exercise 6.8: Problem 8 (parts e & f)

```{r}
set.seed(114514)
X = c(rnorm(100))
N = c(rnorm(100))
β0=114
β1=514
β2=1919
β3=810
Y = c(β0 + β1*X + β2*X^2 + β3*X^3 + N)
df=data.frame(X,X^2,X^3,X^4,X^5,X^6,X^7,X^8,X^9,X^10,Y)
```



#(e)
```{r}
set.seed(114514)
library(glmnet)
x = model.matrix(Y~.,df)[,-1]
y = df$Y

train = sample(1:nrow(x), nrow(x)/2)
test = (-train)
y.test = y[test]

lasso = glmnet(x[train,], y[train], alpha=1)
cv.out = cv.glmnet(x[train,],y[train], alpha=1)
plot(cv.out)
bestlam = cv.out$lambda.min
bestlam

out = glmnet(x,y,alpha=1)
lasso.coef = predict(out, type="coefficients",s=bestlam)
lasso.coef
```

```{}
We can find that Lasso method creates a model with β0, β1, β2 and β3, and other coef are all 0. That means the model is clearly provides an accurate estimation of the real model.
```



#(f)
```{r}
set.seed(114514)
β7 = 100
Y2 = c(β0 + β7*X^7 + N)
df2 = data.frame(X,X^2,X^3,X^4,X^5,X^6,X^7,X^8,X^9,X^10,Y2)
```

```{r}
#best subset
library(leaps)
regfit.full2 = regsubsets(Y2~.,data=df2,nvmax=10)
reg.summary = summary(regfit.full2)
reg.summary
reg.summary$cp
reg.summary$bic
reg.summary$adjr2
```
```{}
According to cp and bic, they are lowest at one variable model. So the model with with the x^7 term is the best choice.
```

```{r}
#Lasso
x2 = model.matrix(Y2~., df2)[,-1]
y2 = df2$Y2

train2 = sample(1:nrow(x2), nrow(x2)/2)

cv.out = cv.glmnet(x[train,], y[train], alpha=1)
bestlam2 = cv.out$lambda.min

out2 = glmnet(x2, y2, alpha=1)
lasso.coef2 = predict(out2, type="coefficients", s=bestlam2)
lasso.coef2
```
```{}
We can see Lasso model also results in a model with one variable X7. Also, the model is a good estimation of the real model.
```
