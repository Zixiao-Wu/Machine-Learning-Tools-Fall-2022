## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r, '3.7 Exercises Problem 10'}
library(MASS)
library(ISLR)
Carseats = na.omit(Carseats)
head(Carseats)
attach(Carseats)
```


#(a)
```{r, '(a)'}
sales = lm(Sales ~ Price + Urban + US, data=Carseats)
summary(sales)
```


#(b)
```{'(b)'}
1. the intercept represents the number of car seats sold when all other predictors = 0;
2. the coefficient of price  = -0.05, means when price increases by 1 and other predictors are constant, sales decrease by 54.
3. the coefficient of urban = -0.02, but it is not significant, means it does not affect the sales.
4. the coefficient ofus = 1.2, means when the sales is in the us, the sales will increase by 1200. 
```


#(c)
```{'(c)'}
Sales = 13.04 - 0.02 * Urban + 1.20 * US - 0.05 * Price
      = 13.04 - 0.02 * Urban + 1.20 * US - 0.05 * Price,                      (Urban=1, US=1)
      = 13.04 - 0.02 * Urban + 1.20 * Price,                                  (Urban=1, US=0)
      = 13.04 + 1.20 * US - 0.05 * Price,                                     (Urban=0, US=1)
      = 13.04 - 0.05 * Price,                                                 (Urban=0, US=0)
```


#(d)
```{}
we can reject the H0 hypothesis for the intercept, US and Price according to the p-value in the summary of the model above. 
```


#(e)
```{r}
sales2 = lm(Sales ~ Price+US, data= Carseats)
summary(sales2)
```


#(f)
```{}
The Residual standard error goes from 2.47 to 2.46, remian the same, and the Adjusted R-squared remian in 0.23.
So neither model is very well, given the low value of and R-squared.
```


#(g)
```{r}
confint(sales2)
```


#(h)
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(sales2)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(rstudent(sales2))
plot(hatvalues(sales2))
rstudent(sales2)[which(rstudent(sales2)>3)]
```

```{}
Based on the Residuals vs Leverage plot and Hatvalues plot, we can see there are no evidence of high leverage observation. 
```
