## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
# auto = read.csv('D:\\daily\\WashU\\机器学习\\set\\ALL CSV FILES\\Auto.csv')
# auto = na.omit(auto)
```

```{r}
library(ISLR)
auto <- Auto
dim(auto)
auto = na.fail(auto)
```
#(a)
Quantitative predictor: mpg,cylinders,displacement,horsepower, weight, acceleration, year.
Qualitative predictor: name, origin.

#(b)
```{r}

sapply(auto[, 1:7], range)
```

#(c)
```{r}
sapply(auto[, 1:7], mean)
sapply(auto[, 1:7], sd)
```

#(d)
```{r}
newauto = auto[-c(10:85),]
dim(newauto)
sapply(newauto[, 1:7], range)
sapply(newauto[, 1:7], mean)
sapply(newauto[, 1:7], sd)
```

#(e)
```{r}
pairs(~ auto$mpg + auto$cylinders + auto$displacement + auto$horsepower + auto$weight + auto$acceleration + auto$year)
hist(auto$acceleration)
```
We can see displacement has a positive correlation with horsepower and weight, and mpg has a negative corrrelation with displacement, horsepower and weight. 
We can also know that acceleration has a approximate normal distribution.


#(f)
```{r}
According to the data and plots above, we can assume that the mpg can be predicted by variables such as displacement, horsepower and weight. The mpg has a negative relationships with displacement, horsepower and weight. So we can predict the mpg to decrease as displacement, weight and cylinder increase.
