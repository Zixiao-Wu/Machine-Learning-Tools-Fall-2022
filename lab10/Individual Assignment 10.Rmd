Exercise 10.7: Problem 9

(a)
```{r}
set.seed(114514)

hc = hclust(dist(USArrests), method = 'complete')
plot(hc, cex = 0.7)
```


(b)
```{r}
hccut = cutree(hc, k=3)
hccut
```


(c)
```{r}
ussc = scale(USArrests)
hcsc = hclust(dist(ussc), method = 'complete')
plot(hcsc, cex = 0.7)
```


(d)
We can find that original model has a height of 10, and the scaled model is 6, means that the clusters are different. 
In general, variables with different measurement units should be scaled before computing the inter-observation dissimilarities. From this model we can also scale the variable to make every variable has a equal measurement.
