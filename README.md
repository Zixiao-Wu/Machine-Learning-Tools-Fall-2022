# **Machine Learning Tools for Prediction of Business Outcomes Fall 2022**

This repository contains the Module assignments and its solution contained in the book An Introduction to Statistical Learning. Also the Python version of the sloution.

[An-Introduction-to-Statistical-Learning](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ff2adbe3fe4fe33db902812/t/6062a083acbfe82c7195b27d/1617076404560/ISLR%2BSeventh%2BPrinting.pdf) is one of the most popular books among data scientists to learn the conepts and intuitions behind machine learning algorithms, however, the exercises are implemented in R language. To overcome this and build my Python ability I have tried solving all the questions in practical exerices in Python language, so people using python language can also get the most our of this amazing book.

## **Course Objectives**

1. Understand the language of predictive analytics to communicate effectively with both experts and colleagues
2. Understand the bias-variance tradeoff and impact of it on predictive models
3. Master predictive analytics tools, applying them correctly to solve business problems. Among these tools are
    • Classification Trees& Regression Trees
    • Random Forest (Committee of Trees)
    • Boosted Trees (This is a good competitor for Neural Network)
    • Neural Network
    • Logistic Regression
    • Multi Adaptive Regression Splines
    • Association Rules
    • K-Nearest Neighbors
    • Principal Component Analysis
    • K-means Clustering
4. Develop Proficiency in utilizing software to build models
5. Analyze current business problems using the above tools
